# ISTRICI Tools: 

## The background of the ISTRICI 

The ISTRICI tool, short for Structural Inversion of Common Image Gathers, was originally developed by Umberta Tinivella and Michela Giustiniani at the National Institute of Oceanography and Applied Geophysics - OGS. 
Detailed information about ISTRICI can be found in the open access article "**ISTRICI - Tools for facilitating seismic depth imaging and velocity analysis with seismic unix**", published in ***Computers and Geosciences*** in 2023. The article is available for download at the following links:

## The trigger of this projects  

The original codes in the project provided by Dr Tinivella and Dr Giustiniani are listed in the repository `ISTRICI`  
https://github.com/utinivella/ISTRICI  
However, the raw codes are not well maintained and developped after all the geophysics is not a very 'popular major'.  The author had a chance to use this tool `ISTRICI` in processing 
some seismic survey lines in the Tryhenian Sea. During this procedure, I wrote some tools which can be used during the Pre-stack Depth Migration (PSDM) based on the Python. Also, I 
modified and developped the original work flow `ISTRICI_TRAD_v1`, mainly based on the Shell script.
