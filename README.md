# ISTRICI Tools: 

## The background of the ISTRICI 

The ISTRICI tool, short for Structural Inversion of Common Image Gathers, was originally developed by Umberta Tinivella and Michela Giustiniani at the National Institute of Oceanography and Applied Geophysics - OGS. 
Detailed information about ISTRICI can be found in the open access (OA) article "**ISTRICI - Tools for facilitating seismic depth imaging and velocity analysis with seismic unix**", published in ***Computers and Geosciences*** in 2023. The article is available for download at the following links:

## The trigger of this projects  

The original codes are provided by Dr Tinivella and Dr Giustiniani listed in the repository `utinivella/ISTRICI`: 
https://github.com/utinivella/ISTRICI  
The raw codes in the above repository are very "clean" and someplaces lack of comments which may be very hard for new users in geophysics or the Seismic Unix.  
Since I had a chance to use their successful tool `ISTRICI` in processing some seismic survey lines in the Tryhenian Sea. During this procedure, I 
wrote some supplementary tools which can be used during the Pre-stack Depth Migration (PSDM) based on the Python. 
Also, I modified and rewrote some scripts with more detailed comments from the original work flow `ISTRICI_TRAD_v1`, mainly based on the Shell script, make it more friendly to first users.
