# ISTRICI Tools: 

## The background of the ISTRICI 

The ISTRICI tool was orginally produced by Umberta Tinivella and Michela Giustiniani at National institute of Oceanography and Applied Geophysics - OGS. 
The ISTRICI stands for the Structural Inversion of Common Image Gathers. The details about the ISTRICI can be found in the article '*ISTRICI - Tools for facilitating seismic depth imaging and velocity analysis with seismic unix*' in the journal ***Computers and Geosciences*** in 2023, which is **OPEN ACCESS**, can de downloaded from

## The trigger of this projects  

The original codes in the project provided by Dr Tinivella and Dr Giustiniani are listed in the repository `ISTRICI`  
https://github.com/utinivella/ISTRICI  
However, the raw codes are not well maintained and developped after all the geophysics is not a very 'popular major'.  The author had a chance to use this tool `ISTRICI` in processing 
some seismic survey lines in the Tryhenian Sea. During this procedure, I wrote some tools which can be used during the Pre-stack Depth Migration (PSDM) based on the Python. Also, I 
modified and developped the original work flow `ISTRICI_TRAD_v1`, mainly based on the Shell script.
